      <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
      <p>
      Greetings! My name is Richard Sullivan. I am a Computer Science student
      currently attending university at Texas State. Over the course of my CS
      journey I have been helped by countless individuals to whom I devote
      this site to. While this site is made in part to be a supplement for my
      resume, the primary goal is to create a space for people to learn, find
      entertainment, and overall be inspired to pursue computer science as a
      hobby or career.
      </p>

      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
      First and foremost I was born and raised in Austin,Texas. When I'm not
      studying, or spending time with the fam, you can often find me out hiking
      and swimming in the greenbelt, excercising at the climbing gym, or
      rollerskating with my lovely girlfriend. I have always been the kind of
      person who likes to explore what experiences life has to offer and to
      go the path least traveled. While my main focus recently has been school,
      once I get out I plan on traveling and working to improve my spanish.
