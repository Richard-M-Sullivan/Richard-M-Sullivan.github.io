I want the website to be a place where I can write simple blog posts as well as projects and tutorials
that I can make public for fun and as a means of use as a resume and helping others.

The first thing that I want to implament is creating a simple site map where I can go through
and organize my material so that way things are easy to find. 

I want there to be tabs for blog posts and projects and tutorials as well as an about me section where
I can list a bit of informaiton about myself as well as some of my credentials as a programmer.

For the blog post section I want to make it to where my posts are organized by year month and day in 
a heirearchy of that order that way it is easy to get around and look at things that are on specific
days in time.

For the tutorial section I want it to be organized by subject and then difficulty and then by tutorial number
and each tutorial in the same category will build on one another.

For the project section I want it to be arranged by name of the project and then by the order of which I post
about the project.
