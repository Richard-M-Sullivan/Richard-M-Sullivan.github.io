      <h1>Hello World</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      Welcome to the first project! I am glad to see that you are interested in
      the course. This is the first step of many that will take you from python
      noob to python master. The hello world program is a tradition amongst
      programmers, and is the first program you should write when trying to learn
      a new language. The program is as simple as it gets.  You will print the
      message "hello world!" to the console. Kinda boring, but I emplore you to
      print different messages and play around with the program a bit after you
      complete the project.

      <h2>Step 1:</h2>
      <p>
      The first step is to install python, and pick a text editor that you
      will want to use to write your python files. I recommend using IDLE as your
      first editor, but feel free to explore other options.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2:</h2>
      <p>
      Now that you have python installed, lets write the hello program. First
      make a new file called <em>hello.py</em>, and open it in the text editor of
      your choice. Then add the text <em>print("hello world!")</em>. Finally,
      open the terminal and run your program with the command <em>python3
      hello.py</em>.
