    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the first project! I am glad to see that you are interested
        in the course. This is the first step of many that will take you from
        python noob to python master. The hello world program is a tradition
        amongst programmers, and is the first program you should write when
        trying to learn a new language. The program is as simple as it gets.
        You will print the message "hello world!" to the console. Kinda boring,
        but I emplore you to print different messages and play around with
        the program a bit after you complete the project.
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1:</h3>
    <p>The first step is to install python, and pick a text editor that you
    will want to use to write your python files. I recommend using IDLE as your
    first editor, but feel free to explore other options.


    <h3>Step 2:</h3>
    <p>Now that you have python installed, lets write the hello program. First
    make a new file called <em>hello.py</em>, and open it in the text editor of your
    choice. Then add the text <em>print("hello world!")</em>. Finally, open the
    terminal and run your program with the command <em>python3 hello.py</em>.
