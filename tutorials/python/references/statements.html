      <h1>What is a Statement?</h1>

      <h2>How Programs are Read in Python</h2>
      <p>
      Python reads code in the same way that one would read a story - from left
      to right and top to bottom. In English we split up ideas into sentences.
      These are units of text that express a complete thought. In Python, we
      use lines to split up our instructions. The Python interpreter will
      read our instructions one line at a time to do work.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Statements</h2>
      <p>
      A statement is a line of code that does something. Examples of types of
      statements are as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
          <li>Assign a value to a variable</li>
          <li>Change the value of a variable</li>
          <li>Check a condition, to run a block of code</li>
          <li>Call a function</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      This list expresses all the things that can be done in Python. In subsequent
      chapters you will learn the different ways of performing those tasks.

      In our hello world program, the instruction <em>print("hello world")</em>
      was a function call, and is a valid statement. If you wanted to print more
      items, you would write another print statement on the next line below.
      </p>

      <h1>Key Words</h1>
      <p>
      In Python there are words that have special meaning. These reserved words
      are not allowed to be used for any purpose other than what Python uses them
      for, other wise the interpreter would get confused. These key words are used
      to build up the types of statements described above and are broken into
      two categories: Structural indicators and operators.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="linkBubble">
      <h1>Operators</h1>
      <p>
      Think of an operator as being like a math symbol. It is used to change the
      value of data and variables. Below are lists of the different types of
      operators and what they do.
      </p>
      <h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
      <p>
      These are symbols that take two values and combine them into a new value.
      </p>
      <p>
      (4 - 7) * 10 / 7 --&gt; -4.28
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>+&nbsp;&emsp;The addition operator adds two numbers</li>
        <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;The difference operator subtracts the right number from the left</li>
        <li>*&nbsp;&emsp;The multiplication operator multiplies two numbers together</li>
        <li>**&nbsp;&ensp;The Exponent operator raises the left number to the power of the right number</li>
        <li>/&ensp;&emsp;The division operator divides the left number by the right</li>
        <li>//&nbsp;&emsp;The floor division operator divides the left number by the right, but discards the remainder</li>
        <li>%&emsp;The modulus operator divides the left number by the right, but only keeps the remainder</li>
        <li>()&nbsp;&emsp;The parenthesis operator evaluates what is inside of them before the outside</li>
      </ul>
      <p/>

      <h2>Comparison Operators</h2>
      <p>
      These are symbols that take two values and compares them. If the comparison is true, then
      it gives back the value True, and if not then it gives back the value False.
      If John has 6 dollars and Susie has 7 dollars, then you could ask: does John have more money than Susie?
      </p>
      <p>
      6 &gt; 7 --&gt; False.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>==&emsp;Evaluates to True if the left item is the same as the right, False otherwise</li>
        <li>!=&nbsp;&emsp;Evaluates to True if the left item is not the same as the right, False otherwise</li>
        <li>&lt;&ensp;&emsp;Evaluates to True if the left item is less than the right, False otherwise</li>
        <li>&lt;=&emsp;Evaluates to True if the left item is less than or equal to the right, False otherwise</li>
        <li>&gt;&ensp;&emsp;Evaluates to True if the left item is greater than the right, False otherwise</li>
        <li>&gt;=&emsp;Evaluates to True if the left item is greater than or equal to the right, False otherwise</li>
      </ul>
      <p/>

      <h2>Logical Operators</h2>
      <p>
      These are symbols that compare True/False values and give back a new True/False value.
      It is often used to make decisions. If it is true that I have money, and it is true that
      I am hungry, then I will go buy food.
      </p>
      <p>
      True and True --&gt; True.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>and&emsp;Evaluates to True if both left and right items evaluate to True, False otherwise</li>
        <li>or&ensp;&emsp;Evaluates to True if either the left or right items evaluate to True, False otherwise</li>
        <li>not&emsp;Evaluates to False if right item is True, and True if the right item is False</li>
      </ul>
      <p/>

      <h2>Assignment Operators</h2>
      <p>
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>=&emsp;This stores a value on the right into a variable on the left</li>
      </ul>
      <p/>

    </div>

    <div class="linkBubble">
      <h1>Structural Indicators</h1>
      <p>
      Structural indicators tell the program that we are going to change the
      order in which the program will be run. Knowing these are beyond the scope
      of this reference article, and each one will have its own reference page.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>def&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;define a function</li>
        <li>if&nbsp;&ensp;&emsp;&emsp;define an if statement</li>
        <li>elif&emsp;&emsp;define an elif statement</li>
        <li>else&nbsp;&ensp;&emsp;define an else statement</li>
        <li>for&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;define a for loop</li>
        <li>while&nbsp;&emsp;define a while loop</li>
        <li>break&nbsp;&emsp;break out of a loop</li>
        <li>return&emsp;return from a function</li>
        <li>yeild&nbsp;&emsp;return from a function, but save the functions internal state</li>
      </ul>
