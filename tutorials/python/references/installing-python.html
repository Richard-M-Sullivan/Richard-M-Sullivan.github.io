      <h1>Installing Python</h1>
      
      <h2>Download From the Python Website</h2>
      <p>
      First go to the <a href="https://www.python.org">official python
      website</a>. Then click the downloads tab, followed by clicking the grey
      button containing the suggested download. This download is an installer
      that will set up the things needed to run python programs on your system.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Run the Installer</h2>
      <p>
      Now that the installer has downloaded, run it and go through the prompts.
      Note that it is important to know where you have python installed if you
      want to change that later. The installer will install a few things: the
      python interpreter, which is called the python launcher, and IDLE, which
      is an basic text editor that makes writing and running python files
      easier. It is pretty basic, and when you get more advanced you are likely
      to not use it, but in the beginning IDLE is a great editor to use as a
      beginner.

      <h1>Additional Tools</h1>

      <h2>Picking a Text Editor</h2>
      <p>
      A text editor is a program that is used for writing plain text files.
      This differs from programs like Microsoft Word that saves files in a rich
      text format. This means that Word embeds additional information into the
      file to tell the program how you want the text to be rendered. While this
      is good for writing papers that are visually pleasing, this is not what
      you want to have happen when writing programs. Make sure that the editor
      you are using edits plain text. Another thing is that you want an editor
      that will highlight words for you, which makes reading code easier on the
      eyes. Some editors that I recommend you look at are VisualStudio Code,
      IDLE, and Sublime. IDLE will be the easiest to use, and well be the only
      editor that I will describe how to use for brevity's sake. I personally
      use the Vim text editor, but I do not recommend this because it has a
      steep learning curve.

      <h1>Writing A Python Program</h1>

      <h2>From IDLE</h2>
      <p>
      Open IDLE, which is installed where the python launcher is. You will see
      a window pop up called the shell. The shell is not used for editing
      python files. It is a window where the output of a running python program
      will display information. To create a new file, click file in the top
      left corner of your screen. You should see a new window pop up called
      untitled. Then click file, save as, and give it the name and location to
      save your program. Before finalizing the name of your file, make sure to
      look at the section below called Naming the File for advice on file
      naming conventions. Now you are ready to write some code!
      </p>

      <h2>From Another Text Editor</h2>
      <p>
      Create a file to hold your program. Make sure the file name aligns with
      the advice in the Naming the File section below. Now that your file has
      been created, open the file up in your text editor. You are now ready to
      write some code!
      </p>

      <h2>Naming the File</h2>
      <p>
      When you save your program make sure that you give it a meaningful name.
      Things like app and program don't offer much in helping you to know what
      is written in the file. Also make sure that you don't have any spaces in
      your file names. While this sounds silly, spaces are a pain when you
      start using the terminal, so I recommend either using camel case
      (thisIsAnExampleOfCamelCase) or using _ and - in place of a space
      (this_is_another_example). Also, when you decide what you want to do, be
      consistent so that you don't have to think about spelling when you are
      searching for a file name. Lastly, when you save your file, make sure
      that it has the extension .py. This tells the computer or any program
      opening the file that it is a python file, which is important for your
      text editor to highlight things correctly.
      </p>

      <h1>Running a Python File</h1>
      
      <h2>From IDLE</h2>
      <p>
      Make sure to save your program, and then click run, and click run module.
      Your program should run and display its output to the shell. You can also
      press f5 to do this with a shortcut.
      </p>

      <h2>From Another Text Editor</h2>
      <p>
      If your text editor, like VS Code, has the ability to run the file from
      the editor, then do that. If not, you will run your file in the terminal.
      To do this, open the terminal, navigate to the location where your
      program is, and finally type in the command python3 nameOfYourFile.py.
      You should see the output of your program get written in the terminal. If
      you don't know terminal commands, you will have to look them up. I
      recommend looking at how to change directories, how to list the files in
      a directory, and how to run, create, and delete files. After learning
      those commands you should be able to do everything needed to complete the
      rest of the tutorials. The terminal is not as scary as it seems, and you
      might come to enjoy using it once you get familiar with some of its
      commands.

      <h1>How Does Python Work</h1>

      <h2>What is Programming</h2>
      <p>
      Programming is solving problems using computers. Kinda vague, I know, but
      the types of problems that programmers solve cover every topic
      imaginable!  From a high level, a program is a set of instructions that
      tell a computer what to do. In the olden days people used to write in
      machine code, but this was complicated and error prone, so people wrote
      programs called compilers that allow people to write programs in human
      readable code, that gets translated into machine code. This is how
      languages like C work. You write a C program, and then you use a compiler
      to generate an executable, which is the machine code instructions that
      the computer can read. Now that computers are so fast, a program called
      an interpreter is used that reads a program and translates it into
      machine instructions on the fly. this is how python works.
      </p>

      <h2>The Python Interpreter</h2>
      <p>
      Python is an interpreted language. What this means is that to run a
      python program you need to have the python interpreter downloaded on the
      computer that you want to run the program on. Then the interpreter will
      read your python file line by line and tell the computer what to do. This
      makes python programs highly portable because they can be run on any
      computer that has a python interpreter - even if the underlying
      architectures of the computers are different.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why do it This Way</h2>
      <p>
      This is benificial because it makes programs portable in that they will
      run on any computer that has the python interpreter installed. Very nice
      for sharing programs with collegues. Another benifit is that programs can
      be run immediately.  Non-interpreted languages need to be compiled.  This
      means that all the translation has to be done before you can run the
      program. For large programs this can take a long time, and you have to
      re-compile it every time that you make changes!  With an interpreter
      there is no need to wait, and changes can be made in real time!
      </p>

      <h1>Common Questions</h1>
      
      <h2>What can I do With Python?</h2>
      <p>
      A better question is, "what can't be done with python?". Python is one of
      the most widely used programming languages, and is used for all kinds of
      applications. It is used for scientific modeling, machine learning, web
      development, and even for making games. The only limit to what can be
      achieved with python is your imagination.
      </p>

      <h2>Isn't Python Considered Slow?</h2>
      <p>
      Yes, python as a language is very slow when compared with other languages
      like c/c++ or Java. That being said, computers are very fast these days,
      and it is ok that a language is slow. One way to think about it is that
      it is ok that you are not driving a race car because there are speed
      limits imposed on drivers. Having a faster car doesn't necessarily equal
      a good experience. One of the benifits of choosing python as a language
      is that it is easy to learn, which is why it widely adopted in scientific
      communities.  Python is also very simple to write because the
      complexities of managing memory is done automatically, this makes writing
      programs way faster, which is why companies like it. Python allows a
      programmers to go from idea to product as fast as possible. Also, some
      libraries that you can use in your python code are written in faster
      languages such as c/c++, which makes python just as fast for certain
      tasks!
      </p>
      
      <h2>Do I Have to be a Genious to Become a Programmer?</h2>
      <p>
      Nope! All you need is a strong sense of curiosity, and to spend the time
      to practice. For the best results, practice every day! Your brain is a
      muscle, and over time you will find that the same problems come all the
      time. Being a good programmer is being able to identify those patters so
      you can build an intuition for how somthing is likely to be solved.
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Thing I Want to Do Isn't Taught on This Site!</h2>
      <p>
      While I'd like to cover everything, I am only me. There is a limit to
      what I can do and teach. But, given that you are able to get through the
      course, you will have a good grasp of the fundamentals. I have faith that
      be the end of this journey, you will be confident enough to start
      learning on your own.  In the end it is up to you to go off on your own
      once you have learned how to do so.
