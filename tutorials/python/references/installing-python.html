      <h1>Installing Python</h1>
      
      <h2>Download From the Python Website</h2>
      <p>
      First go to the <a href="https://www.python.org">official python
      website</a>. Then hover over the downloads tab and click the grey button
      containing the suggested download. This download is an installer that
      will set up the things needed to run python programs on your computer.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Run the Installer</h2>
      <p>
      Once the installer has downloaded, run it and go through the prompts.
      Note that it is important to know where you have python installed if you
      want to change that later. The installer will install a few things: The
      python interpreter (called the python launcher) and IDLE (a basic text
      editor that makes writing and running python files easier).

      <h1>Additional Tools</h1>

      <h2>Picking a Text Editor</h2>
      <p>
      A text editor is a program that is used to write plain text files. This
      differs from Microsoft Word, which saves files in a rich text format.
      Rich text means that Word embeds additional information into the file to
      tell the program how to render the text to the screen. While this is good
      for writing papers that are visually pleasing, this is not what you want
      to have happen when writing programs. Make sure that the editor you are
      using edits plain text. Another thing is that you want an editor that
      will highlight words for you, which makes reading code easier on the
      eyes. Some editors that I recommend you look at are VisualStudio Code,
      IDLE, and Sublime. IDLE will be the easiest to use, and is the only
      editor that I will describe how to use for brevity's sake. I personally
      use the Vim text editor, but I do not recommend starting with this editor
      because it has a steep learning curve.

      <h1>Writing A Python Program</h1>

      <h2>From IDLE</h2>
      <p>
      Open IDLE, which is installed where the python launcher is. You will see
      a window pop up called the shell. The shell is not used for editing
      python files, it is where a python program will display information. To
      create a new file, click <em>file</em> in the top left corner of your
      screen. You should see a new window pop up called <em>untitled</em>.
      Click <em>file</em>, <em>save as</em>, and give it the name and location
      to save your program. Before finalizing the name of your file, make sure
      to look at the section below called 'Naming the File' for advice on file
      naming conventions. Now you are ready to write some code!
      </p>

      <h2>From Another Text Editor</h2>
      <p>
      Create a file to hold your program. Make sure the file name aligns with
      the advice in the 'Naming the File' section below. Now that your file has
      been created, open the file up in your text editor. You are now ready to
      write some code!
      </p>

      <h2>Naming the File</h2>
      <p>
      When you save your program, make sure that you give it a meaningful name.
      Things like 'app' and 'program' don't offer much in helping you to know
      what is written in the file. Also, make sure that you don't have any
      spaces in your file names. While this sounds silly, spaces are a pain
      when you start using the terminal, so I recommend either using Camel Case
      (thisIsAnExampleOfCamelCase) or using _ and - in place of a space
      (this_is_another_example). Make sure to be consistent with file naming so
      you don't have to think about spelling when searching for a file name.
      Lastly, when you save your file, make sure that it has the extension .py.
      This tells the computer, or any application opening the file, that it is
      a python file. This is especially important for your text editor to
      highlight things correctly.

      <h1>Running a Python File</h1>
      
      <h2>From IDLE</h2>
      <p>
      Make sure to save your program. Then click <em>run</em>, and click <em>run module</em>.
      Your program should run and display its output to the shell. You can also
      press <em>f5</em> to do this with a shortcut.
      </p>

      <h2>From Another Text Editor</h2>
      <p>
      Run your file from your editor if your text editor, like VS Code, has the
      ability to do so. If not, you will run your file from the terminal.  Open
      the terminal, navigate to the file location of your program, and finally
      type in the command <em>python3 nameOfYourFile.py</em>(on windows use
      <em>py nameOfYourFile.py</em>. You should see the output of your program
      get written in the terminal. If you don't know terminal commands, you
      will have to look them up. I recommend looking at how to change
      directories, how to list the files in a directory, and how to run,
      create, and delete files.  After learning those commands, you should be
      able to do everything needed to complete the rest of the tutorials. The
      terminal is not as scary as it seems, and you might come to enjoy using
      it once you get familiar with some of its features.

      <h1>How Does Python Work</h1>

      <h2>What is Programming</h2>
      <p>
      Programming is using computers to solve problems. Kinda vague, I know,
      but the types of problems that programmers solve cover every topic
      imaginable! At a high level, you can think of a program as a set of
      instructions that tell a computer what to do. In the olden days people
      used to write in machine code, but this was complicated and error prone.
      Later on, people wrote programs called compilers that allowed people to
      write in human readable code - aka programming languages. For Example, if
      you write a C program, you then need to use a compiler to generate an
      executable. The executable is the machine code instructions that the
      computer can read.  Now that computers are so fast, a program called an
      interpreter is used to read and translate programs into machine
      instructions while the program is running. This is how python works.
      </p>

      <h2>The Python Interpreter</h2>
      <p>
      Python is an interpreted language. This means that to run a python
      program you need to have the python interpreter installed on your
      computer. Then, the interpreter will read your python file one line at a
      time and tell the computer what to do. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why do it This Way?</h2>
      <p>
      This is beneficial because it makes programs portable. This means that
      they will run on any computer with a python interpreter installed, which
      is very nice for sharing programs with colleagues. Another benefit is
      that programs can be run immediately. Non-interpreted languages need to
      be compiled, so all the translations have to be done before you can run
      the program. For large programs this can take a long time, and you have
      to re-compile it every time that you make changes! With an interpreter,
      there is no need to wait, and changes can be made in real time!
      </p>

      <h1>Common Questions</h1>
      
      <h2>What can I do With Python?</h2>
      <p>
      A better question is, "What can't be done with python?". Python is one of
      the most widely used programming languages and is used for all kinds of
      applications. It is used for scientific modeling, machine learning, web
      development, and even for making games. The only limit to what can be
      achieved with python is your imagination.
      </p>

      <h2>Isn't Python Considered Slow?</h2>
      <p>
      Yes, Python as a language is very slow when compared with other languages
      like c/c++ or Java. That being said, computers are very fast these days,
      and it is ok that a language is slow.  One of the benefits of choosing
      python as a language is that it is easy to learn, which is why it widely
      adopted in scientific communities. Python is also very simple to write
      because the complexities of managing memory is done automatically; this
      makes writing programs way faster, which is why companies like it. Python
      allows a programmers to go from idea to product as fast as possible.
      Also, some libraries that you can use in your python code are written in
      faster languages such as c/c++, which makes python just as fast for
      certain tasks!
      </p>
      
      <h2>Do I Have to be a Genius to Become a Programmer?</h2>
      <p>
      Nope! All you need is a strong sense of curiosity, and to spend the time
      to practice. For the best results, practice every day! Over time you will
      build an intuition for how to go about solving problems.
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Thing I Want to Do Isn't Taught on This Site!</h2>
      <p>
      While I'd like to cover everything, I am only me. There is a limit to
      what I can do and teach. But, given that you are able to get through the
      course, you will have a good grasp of the fundamentals. I have faith that
      be the end of this journey you will be confident enough to start learning
      on your own.
