      <h1>Weight in Jellybeans Calculator</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      Congratulations on writing your first program! Now we can start getting
      into the meat and potatoes of programming. Let's start with a conversion
      calculator. We will ask the user of the program to enter their weight,
      and then we will convert that into the number of jellybeans that would be
      of the same weight. Just know that from here on out you will be exposed
      to a lot of information, so don't feel like you need to memorize
      everything. Just learn enough to complete the projects and overtime you
      will get a feel for how things work.

      <h1>Instructions</h1>

      <h2>Step 1:</h2>
      <p>
      The first step is to setup the project. Make a new python file, give it
      an appropriate name, and have it open in the editor of your choice.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2:</h2>
      <p>
      Create a variable called <em>weight</em>, and use the input command to prompt the user
      to enter their weight.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 3:</h2>
      <p>
      Create a new variable called <em>jellybeans</em>, and store the number of jellybeans
      you would need to equal their weight. Note: 1 pound = 400 jellybeans.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 4:</h2>
      <p>
      Lastly, display your results to the user: your weight in jellybeans is ___.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 5:</h2>
      <p>
      Run your program. Note that it will expect you to type in your weight and
      hit enter. After you get the program working, try typing in something
      that is not a number to see what happens.
