      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p> 
      Over the years of learning python, I have found that a lot of courses for
      beginners are either too dry, or too difficult for users to understand. I
      think the main reason is that the pacing for many of the textbooks out
      there come from an information first approach. This means that they are
      motivated to give you all the things you need to know up front. This
      preloading is nice in that you learn alot, but without practice it is
      difficult to retain everything. Thus the approach that I want to use for
      this series of tutorials is a project based implementation. The idea is
      simple: learn as you go, and only learn what you need for the task at
      hand. Why do do this? Wont people leave without a clear understanding of
      all the python features? Yes! And that is ok! As I have embarked along my
      programming journey I have realized that the primary skill a programmer
      needs is google-fu - the ability to find answers to the problems that you
      have. Over time, after doing projects and reading, you will pick up the
      skills and knowledge you need. This means everything that you do will be
      useful and you can get up and running really quickly. This is especially
      important for the beginner who, in the beginning, needs to make steady
      progress to feel accomplished.
      </p>

      <h2>How To Go Through The Course</h2>
      <p>
      The course is split up into two parts. The first section is the Projects
      Section. This contains all the projects that will take you from zero to
      hero in python. Complete the projects to complete the course. The second
      section is the Reference Section. If you have difficulties knowing what to
      do or need a reference for somethig you forgot, the Reference Section is
      your friend. This section is meant to be the accompanied reading for the
      projects. The beauty is that you are not expected to read each chapter in
      totality, but rather look for the informatin that is the most relevant to
      the task at hand. On your first time looking at a chapter you will need to
      read most of it, but as you progress you may only need to check for
      specific topics to brush up on. Do your best to read through the Reference
      Section before you go to google. This might seem like a strange request
      being that programmers only need to know google-fu, but the readings are
      tailored specific to the projects, and will likely be easier to use. That
      being said, for the more difficult projects, or if you can't find the
      information that you are looking for, google away! In each project will be
      a list of relevant chapters to read that will both give help in completing
      the projects as well as hints as to how to complete a given task.
