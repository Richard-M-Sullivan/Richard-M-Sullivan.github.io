            In programming there is nothing more rewarding that seeing a project through to its conclusion,
            but once a project surpasses a certain size the management and organization of the project 
            becomes just as important as writing the code itself. Often times this means setting goals to keep up
            with deadlines, working with others to share a workload, managing lots of files used for testing and development,
            and working with versions of your project in various stages. This tutorial will cover using Git to help with
            managing and organizing files, and Trello to plan and schedule tasks. The ultimate goal is to provide for you
            the tools necessary to stay organized and start working on the same project with others.
