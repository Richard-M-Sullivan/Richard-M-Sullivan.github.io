			Git is a tool that is ubiquitous among programmers in the industry. This is because the need for version
			control software is imperative when working in groups and for keeping a rolling history of a project.
			In this tutorial we will learn when, why, and how to use git.

			<h2>Step 1: Understanding The Problem</h2>
			<p> 
				Whether it be learning how to implement an algorithm or the syntax of a programming language, the first 
				step to achieving your goal is to gather a complete understanding of what you want to accomplish.
				If you only have a vague idea of what you want then you will need to do research to make that
				idea more concrete. The goal of this step is to identify gaps in knowledge and to build awareness of all the
				options available. For me, this is done primarily as described by the two methods below.
			</p>

			<h3>Method 1: Taking in Information Pertaining to The Topic</h3>
			<p> 
				During this phase, your goal is to answer clarification questions: what is ___ , how do I ___ , how does ___
				work. This part of the process is usually dry, and your time should be centered around looking up jargon, reading
				documentation, and reading from books and sites related to your topic. I often find myself
				jumping between reading and making test files; I practice implementing what I read to internalize what I have learned.   
			</p>

			<h3>Method 2: Look at Solution Examples </h3>
			
			<! explain how examples cause you to learn through experimentation and play. What does that look like?>

			<p>
				Often times, what you want to accomplish has already been done before. I don't condone copying 
				what others have done (please don't!), but I do think that looking at examples is a helpful tool. What makes examples so powerful is 
				the ability to build an intuition for how a solution works through experimentation and play. This is done through changing the original
				program to see what effect those changes have. 
				Another reason is the exposure to varying solutions for the same problem. This is critical; because you are no longer restricted to
				solutions inline with your own thought process, you will be provided new angles to attack problem from that you hadn't thought of before
				- often times this new perspective can be applied to new problems in the future. Just be careful because not all solutions
				that you find will be good. While this method is a powerful learning tool, there is potential to use this as a
				crutch, preventing you from learning if you rely on others to do all the work for you.
