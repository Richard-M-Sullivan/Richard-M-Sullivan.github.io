			Git is a tool that is ubiquitous among programmers in the industry. This is because the need for version
			control software is imperative when working in groups and for keeping a rolling history of a project.
			In this tutorial we will learn when, why, and how to use git.

			<h2>Why is collaboration so difficult?</h2>
			<p> 
				Imagine you are in a group and want to write a paper with a group of people. A way that this could be
				done would be to take turns, or to break the paper into sections so people do not have to overlap work.
				On the surface this seems to be a good strategy, but where things get tricky is where there are sections
				that have an overlap on whose responsibility it is to edit that portion of the paper. Perhaps two people
				have been assigned to edit the same section. A way to keep things organized is to work one at a time to 
				prevent overriding someones work, but this is very inefficient because it limits the amount of people that
				could be doing work at a given time. A way to overcome this is to employ a version control system that tracks
				the changes that people make in order to make it easier to collaborate with others while avoiding conflicts 
				while at the same time allowing people to work concurrently with overlapping responsibilities.
			</p>

			<h3>Keeping Up to Date</h3>
			<p> 
				Version control systems help keep people in sync with one another by allowing the people in the project to be
				able to update a central document that can be downloaded edited and updated again by the other people in the
				group. By being able to access the document with the most recent changes you are able to remain in sync with
				what others have added to see how it affects the parts that you are working on. 

			</p>

			<h3>Managing Conflicting Edits</h3>
				Sometimes people need to edit the same document, and by doing this separately creates two conflicting versions 
				of the document where two people have edited the same thing. Version control systems help by tracking changes
				and intelligently bringing the two edited documents together and creating a new version that is the sum of the
				two edited documents. Sometimes though there are two or more edits on the same content, and this results in a 
				problem when the two documents are combined. Version control software shows you where these happened and directs
				you to be able to go in and resolve the edits to ensure that things are running smoothly.
			<p>

			<h2>Version Control Software</h2>
			<p> 
				Version control software allows you to be able to maintain a central document that people are able to download,
				edit, and re-upload so that people are able to update their own documents to match the most recent version of the 
				central document. Version control software also tracts your revisions to the document over time. This feature is
				nice because it allows you to go back to a previous state of the project if something goes wrong, or if the project
				goes in a direction that is undesirable. Lastly version control software aids in collaboration with others by
				allowing members to stay in sync with one another, to help merge files edited by several people, and to allow
				people to create their own versions of the project that allows them to work separately from the group on a feature
				and allows them to add their additions to the project after they get the feature working. 

			</p>

			<h2>Git</h2>
			<p>
				Git is a form of version control software that runs in the command-line. It is incredibly popular, and is the 
				backbone for the github service. 
			</p>

			<h3>Git Installation and Set-Up</h3>
			<p>
				To install and get Git up and running, go to the Git website and download the correct installer for your platform.
				The installer is very simple and comprehensive to follow, and it sets up the program and makes it accessible from the 
				commandline. All that is left to do after installing is to supply Git with your personal information so that it can 
				give you credit for the changes that you make to your project. In order to do that there are a few commands that you
				need to do. To add a your name you will run the command:    To add your email enter the command :     After doing that,
				Git will be all set up and ready to go to start your project. 
			</p>
			
			<h3>Setting Up Git-Hub</h3>
			<p>
				The first thing that you need to do is to create a github account. to do this go to the github website and create
				your account. Git-Hub is different from Git in that it is not version control software, but rather a server where
				you can store documents and projects that you are managing with git. It is just a place where you can keep your 
				projects as well as share them with others. 
			</p>

			<h3>Starting a Project With Git and Git-Hub</h3>
			<p>
				The way that I start making projects is that I first create it on Git-Hub. To do this click on create new repository.
				You will then be prompted to provide a name, select a language for your project, and if you want to add some initial files 
				like a README file or a .gitignore file. The readme is what you add to your project so that people downloading your project
				can read how to set things up and how to use your project. The .gitignore file tells git what files are not relevant to your 
				project and should be ignored, excluded from the project when you edit and update things. After the repository is created on
				git-hub, you can then go into git and clone the repository where you want it to be. Note that cloning the repository will
				automatically put it into a folder that is the name of your project. After you clone the repo you are done setting up and 
				creating a project. Now all you have to do is work on your application.
			</p>

			<h2>Structure of Git</h2>
			<p>
				The way git works is that you have a main file that serves as the end product. Then, from that master file, you download
				another copy, which you work on. This copy is what is on your computer. When you are done working on your copy of the project
				you document your changes as well as write about what changes you made so that you can go back later and see all of your revisions
				that you have done. Lastly you update the master copy to match the contents of the working copy. In this way there is a level of 
				separation as to what is in the final product and what you are working on. this allows you to experiment and try new things with out
				the risk of messing up your project in a way that is difficult to undo.

			</p>

			<h3>Local and Remote Repo</h3>
			<p>
				If you are using Git-Hub, the version of your project that is uploaded to that service is the remote repository.
				The working copy that you have on your computer is the local copy. The idea that there are many versions of the same
				project that you have access to is something that is difficult to wrap your brain around at first, but being comfortable
				with that idea will help you to fully understand and appreciate what git affords you to do. The flow for working with git
				is to update the local copy with the remote one, and then you work on the local copy until you make progress and come to 
				a stopping point. Then you log your changes and finally update the remote repository to contain the changes that you made
				in the local version.

			</p>

			<h3>Staged Committed and Pushed</h3>
			<p>
				In order to log your changes you have to understand how git tracks your files. you have three holding areas. The first is 
				just the documents in your project, the second is a staging area where you flag files that you have made changes to and would
				like to include when you document your changes. The third and final holding area is where you finalize your change and add a comment
				of what your change was and save it to the repository. Once the change is saved then you can upload it to the remote repository.
				in order to take documents from the document container and add them to the staging area, alerting git that these are the files that
				you want to be tracked when you log your final change, uses the add command. You type in add and then the names of the files that you
				want git to look at when you log your changes. I personally use git add . a lot because it adds all the files that have been changed. 
				If you only want to add specific files, or you edited lots of files, but you want only some to be logged as a specific type of change 
				and the others to be logged as a different type of change you can add specific files and log the first change and then add the rest of the files
				to log the second change that you want to do. Lastly to finalize your changes you type in the command git commit, which will allow you to type in 
				a message that you can read later on when looking for a specific change. It is a good idea to do lots of commits as you go to make sure that 
				the changes that you make aren't too large to where you have done tons of stuff in the same commit. This is because you might want to go back to
				a specific moment in the project before a bug was introduced, and the smaller the edits that you have made per commit means you have 
				increased flexibility to where you can go back to. commits finalize changes and allows you to timestamp and label your changes with a description
				for use later on.

			</p>

			<h2>Remote and Local Repository Management</h2>
			<p>
				remote and local repository management is key for making your changes available to others that are accessing your project through the
				remote repository. To do this we have to update the remote repository as well as our own if we want to be up do date with the project
				like when a member of your team makes an edit and you want to be able to have access to it.

			</p>

			<h3>Add</h3>
			<p>
				The add command is for telling git to look at certain documents to add the changes that have happened to them to be logged into the 
				staging area. The purpose of this is to accumulate all the changes that you want to log together in a bundle before you log and
				document the changes that you have made. 
			</p>

			<h3>Commit</h3>
			<p>
				A commit is where you take all of the changes that have been added to the staging area using git and and logging that you have
				made a change to the staged documents. This is called a commit because you are committing to logging the current changes that
				you have made into something labelled that you can go back to later. when you do a commit you will be given a prompt to write
				down a little blurb as to what changes you made. When I first started using git I tried making the commit messages as short as 
				possible, but I found that making them minimally short sacrificed clarity for brevity. this is nice when looking at commits 
				because their is less to read and it makes it faster to go back, but it fails in the long run because if your message is not
				specific enough to fully explain the change that you made, then it might be too vague to be of use when looking for something
				specific that you had done.

			</p>

			<h3>Push</h3>
			<p>
				After changes have been committed they are able to be pushed out to change the remote repository to reflect the committed changes.
				The push command takes the committed changes that you have made and it updates the remote repository to reflect those changes.
			</p>

			<h3>Pull</h3>
			<p>
				The pull command updates your local repository to be up to date with the current state of the remote repository. This is useful 
				when you are working with other people because someone else could have updated the remote repo with something that you need to
				make progress on your portion of the project. It is always a good idea to pull every now and again to make sure that a change
				that has taken place hasn't affect your work in any way. By being aware of what other people are doing it is easier to avoid 
				problems in the future where you edit something someone else had worked on causing you to have to fix merging errors when the edits 
				of the documents have to be brought back together.
			</p>

			<h3>Fetch</h3>
			<p>
				A fetch is like a push, but i think it does less stuff and causes fewer change to the local project that a pull would do.

			<h2>Branches</h2>
			<p>
				when you want to work on something without affecting the main project, like when working on a separate feature, or if you
				are experimenting with some aspect of your project that might not pan out it is nice to create a branch to isolate your changes
				from the main version of the project. This is nice because your changes wont affect other people that are working on the main
				project, and it keeps people from changing things while you are doing work. It pushes the conflicts of merging the additions that
				you have made to alter on after you have completed a feature. This makes it to where you don't have to worry about stepping on
				peoples toes all the time and makes you deal with it in only one large event instead of continuously through the project. Just 
				be careful to try and isolate the changes that you make to your own features and functions to prevent editing things that are other's 
				things to edit. This will save you a lot of headache when you are adding portions of the project back together.
			</p>

			<h3>Making a Branch</h3>
			<p>
				to make a branch you use the git branch command. This will allow you to make a branch and to give it a name. I recommend that you
				decide on a naming convention with your group to standardize the names of the branches that y'all make to make it easier to keep track 
				of whose working on what. 
			</p>

			<h3>Deleting a Branch</h3>
			<p>
				if a branch does not pan out, or if you updated the main branch to contain all the changes of the current branch, then there is no
				reason to keep the current branch, so you might want to get rid of it to keep your project nice and tidy. to do this you use the
				delete branch command which looks like this :   This command is pretty simple, but just make sure that you have saved your work 
				elsewhere if you want to delete it. 

			</p>

			<h3>Switching Between Branches</h3>
			<p>
				to switch between branches yo use the checkout function and this is used to go from one place to another to see what changes are
				located in different versions of the repository. This is nice because it allows you to split up your project into several isolated
				chinks that you can bounce between as you wish whilst avoiding conflicts between them. Branches are nice because the other branches
				are unaffected if the current branch doesn't work the other ones will still run.
			</p>

			<h3>Merging Branches</h3>
			<p>
				to merge branches you type in merge, followed by the name of the branch you have changed followed by the name of the branch that you
				want to apply the changes of the first branch to. Most likely you will finish a feature and then you will want to merge that feature
				with the main branch of the application to integrate it into the final product. after you merge the branches the merged branch wont
				need to be around I don't know if merging the branches deletes the merged branch or what.

			</p>

			<h3>Resolving Merge Conflicts</h3>
			<p>
				when you merge branches git will automatically apply the changes and it will make sure that the additions get fit into the 
				main project seamlessly, but sometimes there will be multiple edits on the same content. In this case git will not know what
				edition should be used vs the other, and sometimes a patch is needed to ensure that both editions can stay valid without
				breaking each other. Git will give you a document that is the result of the two documents that has highlighted for you the parts 
				of the document that couldn't be seamlessly integrated together. In this case you will manually go in and fix these conflicts. 
				then after all the patches are in place you can then push your changed document to the remote repository to solidify and finalize
				your changes / apply your changes to the final product.

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				In conclusion git is a powerful tool that will serve yu well in both small and large projects. I love using git because it allows
				me to access my projects on all of my computers. And it keeps it in sync between all of them. It also allows me to share my work
				with others  and it allows others to work with me to complete the projects that I would like to complete. Knowing how to use and
				being comfortable enough with git to learn the things that you need to push forward is an incredibly useful skill. Employers will
				expect you to be familiar with version control, and while you might not use git and a different version control system all the things
				listed in this tutorial can be applied to any version control software in the future.

			<h2>Useful Resources</h2>
			<p>
				Some useful resources include the Git website. They have tutorials and download links to install git. 
				Another resource is this git guide that can act as a refresher for the basic commands that you would want
				to use on a regular basis.
