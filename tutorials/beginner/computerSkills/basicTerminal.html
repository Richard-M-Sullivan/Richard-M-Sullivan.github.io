            As a programmer, the terminal is something you have to get used to. But, don't worry
            because the terminal is not as scary as it seems. The terminal is really useful for 
            launching programs, creating and organizing files, and manipulating files that are hidden
            from you by default. Learning to use the terminal provides you deeper insight and control
            over your computer, which only serves to make your life easier.
            Once you get the basics down, you might enjoy using the terminal on a day to day basis.

            <h2>What is The Terminal?</h2>

            <p>
                Before we can talk about the terminal, we need to discuss what the operating
                system and shell program are. The operating system is a program which allows your computer
                to run. It's purpose is to manage your computer's resources and control how, when, and in what order the 
                programs on your computer run. The shell is a program that takes in an command, passes it to
                the operating system, then reports back the result of the input command. It lets the 
                operating system know what you want it to do, and it lets you know what happened. 
                Now that we have discussed the operating system and shell, we can discuss the terminal.
                Normally you can not interact with the shell directly, so as a result we need a program called 
                a terminal. The terminal provides us a window in which we can write commands for the shell, and 
                it provides a place for us to read the shell's output.
                This all sounds pretty complicated, but if you are confused don't worry. 
                To put it simply, the terminal is just window that allows you to issue commands and
                read what happened.

            <h2>How to Use The Terminal</h2>

            <p>
                The first thing to do is open the terminal application. If you are using a mac or linux computer, then
                this should be a simple process - find the terminal application and click it!.
                If you are on windows then you need to download a
                unix-style terminal emulator because the tutorials assume you are using a specific type
                of terminal program. That being said, when you open the terminal application
                you will be greeted by a black window, which looks like this:
            </p>

            <p>
                The terminal screen has a line of text at the top. That line of text
                is called the command prompt, which lets you know that the terminal
                is ready for you to type in a command.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How do Commands Work?</h2>

            <p>
                The flow of the terminal is to type a command, let it run, and read the information that
                it gives back. To issue a command, there is a specific format you need to use. That format 
                looks like this: <strong>CommandName [options] arguments</strong>. Ok, so what does that mean?
                <strong>CommandName</strong> refers to the name of the command, which is a program that you want to run.
                <strong>Arguments</strong> are pieces of information that a command needs to run.
                For example, there is a command called ls. If you type
                ls into the command line and hit enter, then it will show you all the files and folders
                that are at your current location in the file system. If you type in: <strong>ls ~/Desktop</strong> then you will
                see all the files and folders that are on the desktop. In this case <strong>~/Desktop</strong> is the
                argument being passed to ls.
                ls takes in file locations as arguments, and it will show you all the files and folders 
                at the locations provided. Now that we know about commands and
                arguments we can look at options. An option is a form of argument that you pass to the
                command which changes the nature of what the command does. For example, the command
                <strong>ls ~/Desktop</strong> shows you the files and folders on the desktop, but if you add the
                argument: -a then it will show you not only show the files and folders, but it will also show hidden files and 
                folders that you are normally not supposed to see. The command with the argument -a is formatted like
                this: <strong>ls -a ~Desktop</strong>. ls is the command name, -a is the command option, and ~/Desktop
                is the command argument. Arguments begin with a dash(-) followed by a letter, or two dashes(--) followed by a word.
                You can have as many options as you want. Having many options looks like this: ls -l -a ~/Desktop
                (this command lists all the files and directories on the desktop - including hidden files and displayed in a long format)
            </p>

            <h2>List of The Most Basic Commands</h2>

            <h3>ls</h3>

            <p>
                the ls command stands for list, and it basically just shows you all of the files and
                folders at the location that you specify. If you do not supply any options or arguments
                then it shows you the files at your current location. In the case of ls the argument
                to be provided is a file location and some helpful options are -a which shows hidden
                files and -l which gives you more info about the files than just the names
            </p>

            <h3>cd</h3>

            <p>
                the cd command stands for change directory, and what it does is move your location in the
                file system to your specified location. In the case of cd if you run it without any 
                arguments then it takes you to your home folder. cd takes only one argument, and that is
                the location in the file system that you would like to travel to. This can be a relative
                or an absolute location, and if you don't know what that means then keep reading becasue
                it will be explained later. The cd command does not take any options. 
            </p>

            <h3>pwd</h3>

            <p>
                The pwd command is one of the more simple commands in that you just use it without any
                arguments or options. This command stands for print working directory. What this does
                is that it shows you your location in the file system. This can be helpful for finding
                absolute paths for things.
            </p>

            <h3>touch</h3>

            <p>
                touch is a command that creates files. the way that it works is that you type in the 
                command followed by the name of a file in the format: filename.type . with this command
                you can type in as many file names as you would like and it will make blank files of
                the name and type that you specified.
            </p>

            <h3>mkdir</h3>

            <p> 
                the mkdir command is similar to the touch command except instead of making new files
                the command makes new folders. The command stands for make directory, and a directory
                is a fancy term for folder. This is because technically folders are fancy files that 
                hold the location of the files that are associated with that folder, but don't worry
                about this too much for now because this will be revisited in the future. the way
                that mkdir works is that you type in the name of the command and then you supply the
                name of the folder. Note that folders do not have any extensions so just a name will
                suffice.
            </p>

            <h3>mv</h3>

            <p>
                the mv command stands for move, and it is used to move files around the computer. The way
                that it works is that you supply it two arguments, which are the position of the file you
                want to move and the destination that you want to place the file. Note that you can put
                in the name of more than one file and have as many as you like, but you can have only
                one destination that you put all the files into. the order that you have to type them
                in is commandname files destination. Another thing that is interesting is that the move
                command can also be used to rename a file. This is done by typing in the name of the 
                file to be moved, and then you tell it to place it in the same location but inder a 
                different name, and that looks like this:
            </p>

            <h3>cp</h3>

            <p>
                the cp command stands for copy, and it is used to make a copy of a file that you choose and
                to place it in a destination of your choice. It works by typing the command name followed
                by location and name of the file that you want to copy, and then you specify a new location
                and name that you want to make the new file as. If you want the file to have the same name
                then you only need to specify the destination
            </p>

            <h3>rm</h3>

            <p>
                the rm command stands for remove and is how we delete things. When you delete stuff with
                rm it is permanent and it does not go in the trash bin, but rather is completely removed
                from the system. If you are not sure if you want to delete somthing or not then be 
                cautious with this command becasue there is no going back. The way it works is that you
                have to type in the command followed by the location and name of the file that you
                would like to remove. Then it will remove it. for this command there are some options that
                you will have to know. For deleting folders/directories you will use the option -r and
                often times you have to use -f to force the deletion of stuff that you are only allowed to
                read. Usually you won't have to use the -f option, but it is a good one to know.
            </p>

            <h3>sudo</h3>

            <p>
                the sudo command stands for super user do and it gives you the ability to do lots of
                stuff that you need special privelages to do. Pretty much you wiull use this command
                anytime you are using a command that will put things on or take things off of your
                computer, or if a program needs special access to system files. This command is used
                as a means to run a command that you might not have the ability to with your current
                permissions as a normal user. The way it works is that you type in the command sudo
                then you type in the command that you want to run like normal, and the effect is that
                it will ask for your password before it runs your second command so it can grant
                you admin privelages. It is a very simple and yet incredibly important command thatj
                you will use more and more as you start digging into and learning more about the teminal.

            <h2>The File System</h2>

            <p>
                The file system of your computer is a heirarchical structure in which things are organized.
                In a unix type computer (mac and linux) the filesystem is completely contained inside
                one folder. This folder is called the root folder and the symbol that represents it is
                the /. All the folders in your computer are contained inside of other folders and all 
                things are located inside of the root folder. So here are the locations of some interesting
                folders that you might be familiar with. /Users/username/  this is your home folder
                locaiton /Users/username/Desktop/ this is where the desktop is located.
                the way we show where you are in the computer is by showing all the folders that you
                are in. / means that you are inside of the folder on the left side, so /Users/
                username/Desktop/ means that you are in the desktop folder that is inside your username
                folder which is inside of the Users folder which is inside of the root folder.
                When we use the terminal the default location that you are placed in is your home 
                folder which is at this locaiton /Users/username/ all the actions that you take are
                from within that folder. If you type in ls then it defaults to that location and 
                shows you the contents of the folder that you are currently in. you can change
                your location with cd. If you don't quite get it yet that is ok. Do some googling
                and practice moving around the filesystem.
            </p>

            <h3>What is The File System</h3>

            <p>
                So above we learned that the path shows all the folders you are in, but how do we show
                where a file is inside of that folder heirarchy. The answer is quite simple. You put
                in the path to the file and then you end it with the name of the file. So what does that
                actually look like? Imagine we have a file called program.exe on the Desktop. The path to
                that file looks like this /Users/username/Desktop/program.exe . As you can see we have 
                the sequence of folders followed by slashes that lead up to the file followed by the 
                name of the file. Viola now you can specify files on your computer.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Absolute vs Local Path</h3>

            <p>
                so far what i have showed you is the absolute path, which stands for the path to a 
                file starting at the root of the file system. This is great and we can reach all
                files this way, but there is another way that we can tell the computer where things are
                that is also really helpful. This other method is called the relative path and it is
                the location of the file in the computer using your current location as the starting
                point. Imagine that you are in the desktop and you want to get a file that is also in the
                desktop. Instead of going and typing in the entire path from the root all the way down till
                you reach your current location you simply just have to say ./program.exe . in this case
                the dot (.) represents your current location, which is the path to the desktop. after the 
                dot you can put in the path just like you would normally to go deeper into the file
                system. What if the file that you want is outside of the folder that you are in? we only
                covered how to go deeper into the file system and not out of folders. the way that we 
                go back is with two dots (..) . this means that if we are on the Desktop and we want 
                somthing that is located outside of the desktop then we just have to type in
                ../program.exe  .  this can be chained to gether to keep going back like this:
                ../../../program.exe   and can be done until you make it to the root folder. 
                So remember folder/inside folder  . = current location  .. = previous folder from current
                locaiton.
