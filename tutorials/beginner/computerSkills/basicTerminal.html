    <p>as a programmer the terminal is just something that you will have to get used to, but
    	don't worry the terminal is not as bad or scary as it seems. The terminal is also
    	really useful for certain tasks and will certainly make your life easier. Who knows,
    	once you get past the hard part of getting the basics down, you might actually have fun
    	learning and using the terminal in your daily life.
    </p>

    <h2>What is the Terminal?</h2>

    <p>Before we can talk about the terminal we have to first discuss a few terms. The first of
    	which is the operating system, which is a low level program that allows you computer
    	to run. It basically acts like a resource management system and controls how all the 
    	programs on your computer run. Having a computer that is able to do work is great, but
    	we need a way to communicate with the operating system so that it knows what we want to do.
    	In order to do this a program called the Shell is used. It takes in input and passes it to
    	the operating system, and it takes the result of what ever happens and gives it back to 
    	us. Now we can discuss the terminal. The terminal is a window that allows us to give 
    	commands to our shell program, and it allows us to see and read what the shell program
    	give back. This all sounds pretty complicated, but if you are confused don't worry. 
    	To put it simply the terminal is the window that allows you to delegate commands and
    	read what happened as a result, the shell takes your commands and gives them to the 
    	operating system, and the operating system executes the commands.</p>

    <h2>How to Use the Terminal</h2>

    <p>The first thing to do is to open the terminal. If you are on a mac or linux computer then
    	this should be a simple process, but if you are on windows then you need to download a
    	unix style terminal emulator because command prompt on windows is not that great to deal
    	with and all the tutorials assume you are using a unix style terminal. That being said,
    	when you open it, it should look like thins:</p>

    <p>What you see should be a black screen that has a line of text at the top. That line of text
    	is called the command prompt, which as the name suggests lets you know that the terminal
    	is ready for you to type in a command.</p>

    <h2>how do commands work?</h2>

    <p>The flow of the terminal is to type a command, let it run, and read the information that
    	it gives back. For commands there is a specific format that you have to adhere to that 
    	looks like this: CommandName [options] arguments . Ok, so what does that mean? The 
    	command name refers to the name of the command, and the arguments are what you want to
    	run the command on. For example there is a command that is of the name ls. If you type
    	ls into the command line and hit enter it will list all the files and folders that are
    	at your current location in the file system. If you type in: ls ~/Desktop  then you will
    	see all the files and folders that are on the desktop. In this case ~/Desktop is the
    	argument, which is a fancy way to say the data that you are passing to the program called
    	ls. In this case ls wants a file location as an argument, and it will give you information
    	of what is located at the location that you provided. Now that we know about commands and
    	arguments we can look at options. An option is a form of argument that you pass to the
    	command that changes the nature of how the command runs. For example the command:
    	ls ~/Desktop  will give you the files and folders on the desktop, but if you add the
    	argument: -a then it will show you not only files and folders, but also hidden files and 
    	folders that you are normally not supposed to see. The way that this is formatted is like
    	this: ls -a ~Desktop  . Here we see that ls is the name -a is the option and ~/Desktop
    	is the argument. The way that you specify somthing as an argument is that it has a - in
    	front of it. you can even have many options that would look like this: ls -l -a ~/Desktop
    	</p>

    <h2>List of the Most Basic Commands</h2>

    <h3>ls</h3>

    <p> the ls command stands for list, and it basically just shows you all of the files and
    	folders at the location that you specify. If you do not supply any options or arguments
    	then it shows you the files at your current location. In the case of ls the argument
    	to be provided is a file location and some helpful options are -a which shows hidden
    	files and -l which gives you more info about the files than just the names</p>

    <h3>cd</h3>

    <p> the cd command stands for change directory, and what it does is move your location in the
    	file system to your specified location. In the case of cd if you run it without any 
    	arguments then it takes you to your home folder</p>
    <h3>pwd</h3>
    <h3>touch</h3>
    <h3>mkdir</h3>
    <h3>mv</h3>
    <h3>cp</h3>
    <h3>rm</h3>
