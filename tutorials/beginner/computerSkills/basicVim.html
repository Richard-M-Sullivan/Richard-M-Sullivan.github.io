    <h2> A Programmer's Editor </h2>

    <p>when programming it is important to use the right kind of editor. this is important
        because the computer wants your file to be of a certain type. This text format should be
        plain text, so it is important to use a program that will create a plain text file. For
        example microsoft word does not write text files. This is because word uses it's own
        document format that way it can imbed information about how to make the document look
        rather than just the textual content. Also for certain things text edit for the mac can
        do similar things. It if for these reasons that you should use an editor that does not
        add informaion to your file other than the text that you place into it.</p>

    <h2>What types of editors are there?</h2>

    <p> for programming there are two main kinds of editors. There are text editors and there are
        IDE's. IDE is an acronym that stands for integrated development environment. An IDE is an
        advanced programming tool that allows you to create code projects and the IDE will place
        extra information into your project to make it easier for you to debug your code and it
        will automate a lot of the processies that you would have to do manually like building
        and exporting your project into an app or executable format. An ide is like the microsoft
        word of the programming world, but because for many applications using an ide is a bit of 
        over kill, and should mainly be reserved for larger projects or used on computers that can
        handle running such a large application. The second type is the text editor. This is a 
        program that just lets you edit text. Sometimes it includes some features found in an IDE
        such as code completion and syntax highlighting, but a text editor is a much simpeler 
        program that does less for you and adds less to your project leaving it as just the code 
        that you write and nothing more. I personally prefer using a text editor because it is 
        simpeler to learn, doesn't lock you to a certain platform and gives you the ability to
        mix and match all the programs that you use during the development process, though it is
        often times much more work to get things set up if you don't know the inner workings 
        of how to take code and turn it into a running application. I do reccomend starting out
        with using a text editor in that it will teach you more about the programming process 
        than using an IDE will, and it is simpeler and fater to get started if you use a language
        like pyhton that is not precompiled.</p>

    <h2> What Is Vim </h2>

    <p> Vim is a text editor, but not just any text editor, a text editor that is notoriously
        famous among programmers for it's reliability and it's clever design. What makes vim
        special is that it runs in the command line, which makes it a univeral editor that can
        be run nerely everywhere, even on remote systems that you don't have the ability to 
        use a gui for. Not only that, but vim comes standard on most systems and can be installed
        and used on every type of computer, which makes it nice because the environment that you
        program in will not change between different types of computers. </p>

    <h2> How to Install Vim</h2>

    <p> For most systems vim comes by default. If you have linux then you most likely have vim, and
        if you have mac then you most likely have vim. If you don't, then there are a couple ways
        to get it intalled. If you are on linux you can use your package manager to install vim. 
        just type in apt-get install vim, or the appropriate command for your package manager. For
        mac you can use homebrew, just type into the terminal homebrew install vim. If you don't
        have a package manager then you have to isntall it manually. To do this go to the vim 
        website vim.org and download vim. Make sure to get the correct version for your computer.
        The next step once vim is downloaded is to add vim to the system path, so make sure you
        figure out where vim is downloaded and in the setting of your computer add the path to the
        vim program so that way when you type in vim the computer knows where to look in order
        to use your installed version of vim.</p>

    <h2> How to Use Vim</h2>

    <p> vim si waht we call a modal editor. This means that when you use vim you have to go into
        different modes in order to perform certain tasks. For example there are 4 modes in vim.
        there is insert mode, where you insert text into the document. There is edit mode, where
        you use the keyboard to issue commands on how to edit and manipulate what you have already
        written. There is line mode, where you delegate commands like save and quit or make a new
        window or open a new document. And lastly there is Visual mode where you can highlight 
        and select areas of text. I will leave the explination at that and we will touch on how 
        to select modes and how each one works later in this tutorial, but first we will cover
        some basic operations that will allow you to practice while I explain how things work.</p>

    <h3> how to open a file </h3>

    <p> the first thing to know about using vim is how to open the program and how to open files
        that you want to edit. In order to open vim you type in vim in the commandline and hit
        enter. then you will see the vim startup screen. Don't try to type anything because you
        wont be able to. Vim opens up by default in the edit mode, so hold your horses until I
        explain what to do. In order to open a file from this window press : and type in e 
        followed by a space followed by the name of the file that you want to open like this:
        :e ./myfile.txt  . make sure you use an extension. after you type that in hit enter and
        the file will be pulled up in the viewing window. There is another way to open a file in
        vim, and this is how you do it if vim is not already opened, but you want to open the
        file up with vim directly instead of opening vim first and then opening the file. to do
        this just type in vim followed by a space and then followed by the name of the file that
        you want to edit like this:  vim ./myfile.txt then hit enter and vim will open up with 
        your file open fromt he start. </p>

    <h3> how to save and quit </h3>

    <p> in order to save your file you have to be inside of edit mode, and then press : to go
        into line mode to enter in a command. then press the w key and press enter and the file will be saved. a way to remember this is that the w stands for write file.
        if you want to quit out of vim make sure that you  are in the edit mode and then
        press : to go into line mode to enter a command then type in q and hit enter causing
        vim to shut down. A good way to remember this is that q stands for quit. If you want to
        save and quit, instead of doing them seperately you can do this instead. Make sure that
        you are in edit mode and press : to go into line mode to enter a command. then type in
        wq and then hit enter to write nnd then quit in the same command </p>

    <h3> how to edit the file </h3>

    <p>ok this is the most complicate part of vim so make sure to pay attention and bare with
        me because vim is going to seem awkward and clunky until you are able to wrap your
        head around thins part. First we need to know about edit mode. this mode acts as the 
        central hub from which all other modes are reached, so if you are trying to get into 
        insertmode but can't try to get into edit mode first. Thhis is really important to
        remember because everything is built around the idea that you are to spend most of
        your time editing rather than writing. To get into edit mode you press the escape key.
        sometimes you may have to press it many times, but you will eventually make it into
        edit mode. Once here all of the keys on the keyboard become options and commands instead
        of letters. To move around your document we use the letter keys hjkl and they act in 
        a similar manner to the arrow keys being that h goes left j goes down k goes up and
        l goes to the right. this is one of the ways that you can move around your document.
        in order to delete letters you can type in x and that will delete the letter that is
        under the cursor. That is mainly the only thing you need to know at the tart of editing
        bit there are lots of commands and there are many types of commands that can be combined
        to build even more interesting and powerful commands, but don't worry about this for now
        becasue if you get overwhelmed then you won't be willing to keep on learning.</p>

    <h3> how to write in your file </h3>

    <p> so you now how to edit a file, but we don't know how to add things to the file yet!
        in order to do that you have to go into insert mode. To do this make sure that you are
        in the edit mode and press i. Now you will be in insert mode. In this mode you just
        type and everything works as you expect. when you are done typing and want to move around
        the document again make sure to hit escape to go back into edit mode, which will remap
        the keys to allow you to move around. Make sure to practice switching between edit mode
        and insert mode quickly for this will be hapeining all the time. </p>

    <h3> viual mode </h2>

    <p> this mode is for highlighting and selecting. you go into it by pressing v in edit mode
        this will put you into visual mode. You can move around the same way that you do in
        edit mode, with hjkl, but you will see that a you do it will highlight stuff. this is
        nice for selecting specivfic chunks of text. If you want to copy and paste you can go into
        visual mode and highloght a portion of stuff and then hit the y key, which stands for 
        yank, to copy the highlighted text. Now if you want to paste it you can hit escape to 
        go back into edit mode and then navigate to where you want to paste the text and hit p.
        now you should see the text get printed to the screen. </p>

    <h2> vim tutor </h3>

    <p> there are nearly endless commands and command combinations that are at your disposal and
        we only just barey scratched the surface of what vim is able to do. If you are comfortable 
        using what you know and want to take your vim game futher try typing vimtutor into the 
        command line and this will take you to a tutorial page for vim similar to the one you just
        read except probably better and easier to follow. It will cover more commands than the
        ones I went over and is a good starting point for a beginner. Just keep in mind that vim
        tutor only covers the basics and there is still many many more comands out there. My
        recomendation is that if there is somthing that you keep doing, but havent found a good
        way to do it with the commands that you know there is probably some other commands that you
        could use to accomplish that task, so google it and see what commands other poeople use.
