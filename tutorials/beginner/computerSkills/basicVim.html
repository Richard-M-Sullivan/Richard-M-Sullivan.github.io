            Like all things in life, learning takes time, energy, and effort. Don't expect to finish the
            tutorial having a complete understanding of how to use vim.
            If you don't like using vim at first don't quit!
            Eventually it will get easier once you put in enough time.
            Good luck, and don't stress about learning everything in one go!

            <h2> A Programmer's Editor </h2>

            <p>
                When programming, it is important to use the right kind of editor. This is
                because code files need to be plain text, so use an editor which works with that kind of file.
                Microsoft Word does not work well because Word uses it's own
                document format - it does this to imbed information about how to format the document's
                textual content. It is for this reason that an editor should be used that does not
                add information to your file other than the text itself.

            <h2>What Types of Editors Are There?</h2>

            <p> 
                For programming, there are two kinds of editors. There are plain text editors and 
                IDEs (IDE stands for integrated development environment). An IDE is an
                advanced programming tool which provides extra features such as an automated build process,
                ways to export your project as an application, and tools for debugging.
                An IDE is the Microsoft Word of the programming world, and for many applications using an IDE is
                over kill. This is mainly due to the nature of smaller projects, which are simpler and don't require
                all the tools that an IDE provides. Smaller projects are where the humble plain text editors really shine.
                Plain text editors provide a minimalistic experience, where you have only the basic necessities such as
                code completion and syntax highlighting. I prefer using a text editor because of it's simplicity, 
                and that it doesn't lock you into programming on a specific platform. For beginners I 
                recommend starting out with using a text editor because it doesn't do things for you like an IDE would. This
                is important because it teaches you how to do everything yourself - that way, when you graduate to using an IDE
                you will be able to diagnose and fix problems if the IDE is not able to do what you want.

            <h2> What Is Vim </h2>

            <p> Vim is a text editor that is notorious among programmers. What makes vim
                special is that it runs in the command line. This makes vim a universal editor that can
                be run everywhere, even on computers you only have remote access to. Also, because vim is
                so prevalent it comes pre installed on most unix based computers. It is a learn once and use everywhere
                type of application. </p>

            <h2> How to Install Vim</h2>

            <p> 
                If you don't have vim pre installed then follow the steps below.
                For Linux, use your package manager to install vim: sudo apt-get install vim (for debian based distributions). 
                For Mac, you can use homebrew, just type into the terminal: homebrew install vim. If you don't
                have a package manager, then you have to install it manually. To do this, go to the vim 
                website (vim.org), download vim, and add vim to the system path.
                To do that, figure out where vim is downloaded, then add the path to the
                vim program to the system path in your computer's settings. This is so the computer knows where to
                find the application when you type it into the terminal.

            <h2> How to Use Vim</h2>

            <p> vim si waht we call a modal editor. This means that when you use vim you have to go into
                different modes in order to perform certain tasks. For example there are 4 modes in vim.
                there is insert mode, where you insert text into the document. There is edit mode, where
                you use the keyboard to issue commands on how to edit and manipulate what you have already
                written. There is line mode, where you delegate commands like save and quit or make a new
                window or open a new document. And lastly there is Visual mode where you can highlight 
                and select areas of text. I will leave the explination at that and we will touch on how 
                to select modes and how each one works later in this tutorial, but first we will cover
                some basic operations that will allow you to practice while I explain how things work.</p>

            <h3> how to open a file </h3>

            <p> the first thing to know about using vim is how to open the program and how to open files
                that you want to edit. In order to open vim you type in vim in the commandline and hit
                enter. then you will see the vim startup screen. Don't try to type anything because you
                wont be able to. Vim opens up by default in the edit mode, so hold your horses until I
                explain what to do. In order to open a file from this window press : and type in e 
                followed by a space followed by the name of the file that you want to open like this:
                :e ./myfile.txt  . make sure you use an extension. after you type that in hit enter and
                the file will be pulled up in the viewing window. There is another way to open a file in
                vim, and this is how you do it if vim is not already opened, but you want to open the
                file up with vim directly instead of opening vim first and then opening the file. to do
                this just type in vim followed by a space and then followed by the name of the file that
                you want to edit like this:  vim ./myfile.txt then hit enter and vim will open up with 
                your file open fromt he start. </p>

            <h3> how to save and quit </h3>

            <p> in order to save your file you have to be inside of edit mode, and then press : to go
                into line mode to enter in a command. then press the w key and press enter and the file
                will be saved. a way to remember this is that the w stands for write file.
                if you want to quit out of vim make sure that you  are in the edit mode and then
                press : to go into line mode to enter a command then type in q and hit enter causing
                vim to shut down. A good way to remember this is that q stands for quit. If you want to
                save and quit, instead of doing them seperately you can do this instead. Make sure that
                you are in edit mode and press : to go into line mode to enter a command. then type in
                wq and then hit enter to write nnd then quit in the same command </p>

            <h3> how to edit the file </h3>

            <p>ok this is the most complicate part of vim so make sure to pay attention and bare with
                me because vim is going to seem awkward and clunky until you are able to wrap your
                head around thins part. First we need to know about edit mode. this mode acts as the 
                central hub from which all other modes are reached, so if you are trying to get into 
                insertmode but can't try to get into edit mode first. Thhis is really important to
                remember because everything is built around the idea that you are to spend most of
                your time editing rather than writing. To get into edit mode you press the escape key.
                sometimes you may have to press it many times, but you will eventually make it into
                edit mode. Once here all of the keys on the keyboard become options and commands instead
                of letters. To move around your document we use the letter keys hjkl and they act in 
                a similar manner to the arrow keys being that h goes left j goes down k goes up and
                l goes to the right. this is one of the ways that you can move around your document.
                in order to delete letters you can type in x and that will delete the letter that is
                under the cursor. That is mainly the only thing you need to know at the tart of editing
                bit there are lots of commands and there are many types of commands that can be combined
                to build even more interesting and powerful commands, but don't worry about this for now
                becasue if you get overwhelmed then you won't be willing to keep on learning.</p>

            <h3> how to write in your file </h3>

            <p> so you now how to edit a file, but we don't know how to add things to the file yet!
                in order to do that you have to go into insert mode. To do this make sure that you are
                in the edit mode and press i. Now you will be in insert mode. In this mode you just
                type and everything works as you expect. when you are done typing and want to move around
                the document again make sure to hit escape to go back into edit mode, which will remap
                the keys to allow you to move around. Make sure to practice switching between edit mode
                and insert mode quickly for this will be hapeining all the time. </p>

            <h3> viual mode </h2>

            <p> this mode is for highlighting and selecting. you go into it by pressing v in edit mode
                this will put you into visual mode. You can move around the same way that you do in
                edit mode, with hjkl, but you will see that a you do it will highlight stuff. this is
                nice for selecting specivfic chunks of text. If you want to copy and paste you can go into
                visual mode and highloght a portion of stuff and then hit the y key, which stands for 
                yank, to copy the highlighted text. Now if you want to paste it you can hit escape to 
                go back into edit mode and then navigate to where you want to paste the text and hit p.
                now you should see the text get printed to the screen. </p>

            <h2> vim tutor </h3>

            <p> there are nearly endless commands and command combinations that are at your disposal and
                we only just barey scratched the surface of what vim is able to do. If you are comfortable 
                using what you know and want to take your vim game futher try typing vimtutor into the 
                command line and this will take you to a tutorial page for vim similar to the one you just
                read except probably better and easier to follow. It will cover more commands than the
                ones I went over and is a good starting point for a beginner. Just keep in mind that vim
                tutor only covers the basics and there is still many many more comands out there. My
                recomendation is that if there is somthing that you keep doing, but havent found a good
                way to do it with the commands that you know there is probably some other commands that you
                could use to accomplish that task, so google it and see what commands other poeople use.
