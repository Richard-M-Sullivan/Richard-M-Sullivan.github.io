    <h2> A Programmer's Editor </h2>

    <p>when programming it is important to use the right kind of editor. this is important
        because the computer wants your file to be of a certain type. This text format should be
        plain text, so it is important to use a program that will create a plain text file. For
        example microsoft word does not write text files. This is because word uses it's own
        document format that way it can imbed information about how to make the document look
        rather than just the textual content. Also for certain things text edit for the mac can
        do similar things. It if for these reasons that you should use an editor that does not
        add informaion to your file other than the text that you place into it.</p>

    <h2>What types of editors are there?</h2>

    <p> for programming there are two main kinds of editors. There are text editors and there are
        IDE's. IDE is an acronym that stands for integrated development environment. An IDE is an
        advanced programming tool that allows you to create code projects and the IDE will place
        extra information into your project to make it easier for you to debug your code and it
        will automate a lot of the processies that you would have to do manually like building
        and exporting your project into an app or executable format. An ide is like the microsoft
        word of the programming world, but because for many applications using an ide is a bit of 
        over kill, and should mainly be reserved for larger projects or used on computers that can
        handle running such a large application. The second type is the text editor. This is a 
        program that just lets you edit text. Sometimes it includes some features found in an IDE
        such as code completion and syntax highlighting, but a text editor is a much simpeler 
        program that does less for you and adds less to your project leaving it as just the code 
        that you write and nothing more. I personally prefer using a text editor because it is 
        simpeler to learn, doesn't lock you to a certain platform and gives you the ability to
        mix and match all the programs that you use during the development process, though it is
        often times much more work to get things set up if you don't know the inner workings 
        of how to take code and turn it into a running application. I do reccomend starting out
        with using a text editor in that it will teach you more about the programming process 
        than using an IDE will, and it is simpeler and fater to get started if you use a language
        like pyhton that is not precompiled.</p>

    <h2> What Is Vim </h2>

    <p> Vim is a text editor, but not just any text editor, a text editor that i notoriously
        famous among programmers for it's reliability and it's clever design. What makes vim
        special is that it runs in the command line, which makes it a univeral editor that can
        be run nerely everywhere, even on remote systems that you don't have the ability to 
        use a gui for. Not only that, but vim comes standard on most systems and can be installed
        and used on every type of computer, which makes it nice because the environment that you
        program in will not change between different types of computers. </p>
