		<p>The most important skill a programmer can have is being comfortable with the unknown. 
			This trait is especially important for beginners because the barrier to entry for programming high.
			It's common to feel overwhelmed when encountering something new, and this causes many
			new programmers to quit because they feel incapable of learning all that they need to know.
			When starting my programming journey I had quit many times, but I kept coming back.
			With each attempt I was able to push further than before and gain a greater sense of self confidence. <br><br>

			This chapter will cover the strategy I use to learn new programming concepts quickly.
			This method is a three step process that can be used for any sized project (even ones not related to programming).

			<h2>Step 1: Understanding The Problem</h2>

			<p> Whether it be how to implement an algorithm or learning the syntax of a programming language, the first 
				step to achieving your goal is to gather a complete understanding of what you want to accomplish.
				If you only have a vague idea of what you want then you will need to do research to make that
				idea more concrete. The goal of this step is to identify gaps in knowledge and to build awareness of all the
				options available. For me, this is done primarily as described by the two methods below.
			</p>

			<h3>Method 1: Taking in Information Pertaining to The Topic</h3>
			<p> 
				During this phase, your goal is to answer clarification questions: what is ___ , how do I ___ , how does ___
				work. This part of the process is usually dry, and your time should be centered around looking up jargon, reading
				documentation, and reading from books and sites related to your topic. I often find myself
				jumping between reading and making test files; because, I practice implementing what I read to internalize what I have learned.   
			</p>

			<h3>Method 2: Look at Solution Examples </h3>
			<p>
				Often times, what you want to accomplish has already been done before. I don't condone copying 
				what others have done (please don't!), but I do think that looking at examples is a helpful tool. What makes examples so powerful is 
				the ability to build an intuition for how a solution works through experimentation and play.
				Another reason is the exposure to varying solutions for the same problem. This is critical; because you are no longer restricted to
				solutions inline with your own thought process, you will be provided new angles to attack problem from that you hadn't thought of before
				- often times this new perspective can be applied to new problems in the future. Just be careful because not all solutions
				that you find will be good. While this method is a powerful learning tool, there is potential to use this as a
				crutch, preventing you from learning if you rely on others to do all the work for you.

			<h2>Step 2: break the problem into managable chunks </h2>
			<p> my grandmother would always joke with me about how to eat an elephant. For those who know the saying, you know the
				answer is one bite at a time. Anything that is sufficiently complicated will always be difficult to implement unless
				you are able to break down the problem into a series of simpler and manageable pieces that you can keep organized. 
				One of the biggest problems that I faced when I first started programming was turning my code base into a tangled
				mess of dependancies and often pigeone holed myself into an overly complicated and difficult to understand solution. 
				This might work out for small projects, but unless you can keep your code clean and consise you wont be able to scale
				up into more complicated programs.
			</p>

			<h2>Step 3: work on each piece seperately and slowly bring things together</h2>
			<p>the idea behind this is that you know what each piece is supposed to do, and by working on the pieces separately
				you are more able to test to see if each piece is working properly. If you do them all together you might have an
				error that occurs in one part of your project that the root cause could be somewhere else. Keeping the parts seperate
				ensures that the problems are localized and isolatable. Once you can confirm that a portion of the code is working 
				properly you can then integrate it into your project.
			</p>

			<h2>Things to keep in mind</h2>
			<p>as you work on your projects it is important that you document all the things that you do. This is beneficieal
				for several reasons. the first is that while you are working on your project you are able to go back to see what
				you have already done and what still needs to be worked on. Also it allows you to look back after you have finished
				your project to apprecieate the work that you have done and also to see how you have grown since finishing the
				project. Another reason is that if you need to go back to your project to add onto it then you have lots of 
				documentation to help you relearn the innerworkings of the program. Lastly documentation serves as a record for
				others to see your skills and your growth as a programmer. Documenting projects is a great way to build up a
				resume to share with a possible employer. So always remember to document everything, for getting into the habit
				now will serve you well going into the future.
