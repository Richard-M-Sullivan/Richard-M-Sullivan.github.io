    <h1> how to solve your problems </h1>
    <a href="./tableOfContents.html">back</a>

    <p>In this tutorial we will explore the most important topic about being a programmer, which is being comfortable
    	working with computers. At first these machines may seem intimidating, but they are a powerful tool that allows
    	you to not only write programs to solve problems, but as a means to seek help in understanding
    	and defining the problem you wish to solve. In this field informaiton is everything and there is an endless sea
    	of documentation, forums, and websites at your disposal. This access to informaiton is the single most important
    	asset because it allows you to learn and adapt as you require more tools to get things done. Many believe that
    	it is the programmers job to memorize and understand every part of prgramming, but this is not the case. It is 
    	up to the programmer to have a solud understanding of the founding concepts of programming, but often times
    	it is neccessary to learn on the fly how to utilize a data structure or library to create a solution to 
    	the problem you face. All that matters is that you are able to adapt and aquire skills as needed to finish 
	your projects.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: understanding the problem</h2>
    <p> wheter it be how to implament an algorithm or understanding how to do somthing in your target language, the
    	first step in figuring out how do what you want to accomplish is by having an understanding of the problem.
	this means that you have to do research. When I do research I do it is a few phases, which I will describe below.
    </p>
    <h3>phase 1: a quick survey of the land</h3>
    <p> during this phase your goal is to look up informaiton on what ever it is you want to accomplish. During this phase
    	one of the most important part is learning jargon which may be a hurdle that needs to be jumped in order to make
	sense of the explinations that you read. for example, if you wanted to learn how to do object oriented programmig
	then you should figure out what is meant by the term object oriented as well as other terms like method and member
	variables. Knowing these terms will simplify the process of learning because you will better understand what you
	are able to read on the topic.
    </p>
    <h3> phase 2: look at what others have done </h3>
    <p> often times what you want to accomplish has already been done before, and even though I don't condone copying 
    	verbatum what others have done, I do think that it is really helpful to look at man examples of how people have
	solved your problem. By doing this you can see how different styles of programmers take on the task and it is 
	up to you to understand and make sense of these examples so you can internalize the pattern used to solve the type
	of problem that you are facing because often times you can apply the same pattern with other problems of a similar
	nature to the problem that you are facing now.

    <h2>Step 2: break the problem into managable chunks </h2>
    <p> my grandmother would always joke with me about how to eat an elephant. For those who know the saying, you know the
    	answer is one bite at a time. Anything that is sufficiently complicated will always be difficult to implement unless
	you are able to break down the problem into a series of simpler and manageable pieces that you can keep organized. 
	One of the biggest problems that I faced when I first started programming was turning my code base into a tangled
	mess of dependancies and often pigeone holed myself into an overly complicated and difficult to understand solution. 
	This might work out for small projects, but unless you can keep your code clean and consise you wont be able to scale
	up into more complicated programs.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3: work on each piece seperately and slowly bring things together</h2>
    <p>the idea behind this is that you know what each piece is supposed to do, and by working on the pieces separately
    	you are more able to test to see if each piece is working properly. If you do them all together you might have an
	error that occurs in one part of your project that the root cause could be somewhere else. Keeping the parts seperate
	ensures that the problems are localized and isolatable. Once you can confirm that a portion of the code is working 
	properly you can then integrate it into your project.
    </p>
    <h2>Things to keep in mind</h2>
    <p>as you work on your projects it is important that you document all the things that you do. This is beneficieal
    	for several reasons. the first is that while you are working on your project you are able to go back to see what
	you have already done and what still needs to be worked on. Also it allows you to look back after you have finished
	your project to apprecieate the work that you have done and also to see how you have grown since finishing the
	project. Another reason is that if you need to go back to your project to add onto it then you have lots of 
	documentation to help you relearn the innerworkings of the program. Lastly documentation serves as a record for
	others to see your skills and your growth as a programmer. Documenting projects is a great way to build up a
	resume to share with a possible employer. So always remember to document everything, for getting into the habit
	now will serve you well going into the future.
