          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to the Computer Graphics project. This project covers the 
            creation of two software renderers: a ray tracer and a rasterizer.
            Come with me as I go through the book Computer Graphics From Scratch,
            by Gabriel Gambretta.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="linkBubble">
          <h2>Getting Started</h2>
          <p>
            The book is comprised of pseudo code and written descriptions of how the
            graphics algorithms work. The book makes no assumptions as to what language or
            programming environment you will use, and does not offer help in setting up
            a programming project. Because of this I have the freedom to pick what language,
            IDE, and environment I want to program in.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I chose to program the project in c++. The software renderer will be slow
            by nature (there is no gpu acceleration), so by using c++ the render will be
            made to be as fast as possible givn its limitations.
          </p>

          <p>
            I chose to use Cmake as the bould system because it is a better alternative to
            using a conventional makefile.
          </p>

          <p>
            I will be using the SDL2 library because it is simple to setup and easy to use.
          </p>

          <p>
            I will be programming in the Linux environment because I enjoy Linux and use it
            as my daily driver.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Lastly, I chose to use Visual Studio Code as my editor. It offers a lot in
            terms of syntax highlighting, auto completion, and configurability. It is also
            the industry standard, so being familiar with widely used tools is always a
            good idea.
          </p>

          <h2>Setup of The Project</h2>
          <p>
            First I downloaded cmake. While I am more familiar with makefiles, I decided to
            try cmake to learn how it works. I learned that it is a system that creates
            makefiles. This is important because makefiles are tedious to write and
            difficult to make work cross platform. Because of this cmake is a good tool
            because it fixes all of those issues. 
          </p>
            
          <p>
            Cmake integrates well with visual studio. After installing cmake, I followed a
            short tutorial and wrote a simple file. Then I used the Visual Studio Code tool
            to generate the build folder, which created a make file for me to compile my
            project.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next I installed SDL2 and created a simple program that creates a window. I
            also configured my cmake file to link to SDL2, so I can compile and run my
            project.
          </p>

          <h1>Resources</h1>
          <p>
            I don't want to get into too much detail on how things are set up because it wont
            apply to most people, but I can provide the resources that I used to set things up.
          </p>
             
          <p>
            For cmake and setting up SDL2, just youtube cmake and SDL2 tutorials. there are lots
            of videos to follow, and just pick the one that is most applicable to you.
          </p>
            
          <p>
            For documentation on SDL2 I recommend checking out <a href="https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php">Lazyfoo's website.</a> I found it by
            searching "SDL2 tutorial" on the internet machine. There are many other sites with
            tutorials as well. <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/FrontPage">The SDL2 wiki</a> is also pretty great as well.
