          <h1>Inspiration</h1>
          <p>
            When I was younger, I was always trying to learn how things worked.
            This interest lead me to take up programming, because I wanted to
            understand how video games were made. Since then, I have become
            more interested in machine learning and how to create self changing
            systems. Eventually, I stumbled across a video, by Matt Parker,
            about an AI that was made from match boxes and beads. Fascinated, I
            decided that I needed to make one of my own.

            [1] MENACE: the pile of matchboxes which can learn.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="linkBubble">
          <h2>What is MENACE?</h2>
          <p>
            MENACE is a match box computer thought of and created by Donald
            Michie in 1961[2]. He did this in order to demonstrate adaptive
            learning was possible in computer systems. Matchboxes were used due
            to not having access to a computer at the time[2].
          </p>
          <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
          <p>
            There are 304 match boxes. Each box has a picture on the face that
            represents a board position.  Inside of each box are colored beads
            that when randomly chosen represent the move that MENACE wants to
            make - each color corresponds to a square on the board. You play
            tic-tac-toe with MENACE by picking the box that matches the current
            state of the board, randomly selecting a bead, and making that
            move. Then on your turn you play as normal.  Go back and forth
            between MENACE and you making moves until the game is either won,
            lost, or drawn. MENACE learns between games, because if MENACE
            wins, you put the beads back into their respective boxes with three
            extra of the same color. This makes MENACE more likely to make
            those same moves in the future. When MENACE draws, you just put
            back the beads into the box. This keeps MENACE playing the same.
            And when MENACE loses, you remove the beads that made those
            decisions from the boxes. This makes MENACE less likely to make
            those moves in the future. As a result, MENACE gets more likely to
            make good moves after each game resulting in a win or loss. Over
            time MENACE will go from playing randomly to expert level play.

          <h1>More Information</h1>
          <p>
            The method of learning that is taking place is called reinforcement
            learning, in that we are using punishments and rewards in order to
            steer the machines behavior in the direction that we want. This is
            commonly used for training neural networks.
          </p>

          <h2>Making your own</h2>
          <p>
            If you want to make your own, you can follow along by reading
            through the rest of the project. In all honesty, it is a good bit
            of work to complete, so if you have young kids or no programming
            experience maybe try a simplified version for the game "hexapawn".
            That's what I did after watching the video for the first time, and
            while it is less impressive it is still fun to show off to friends.
