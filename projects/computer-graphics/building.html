          <h1>Inspiration</h1>
          <p>
            Kid, Programming. Interest in machine learning. Saw a video -> find link. Wanted to
            make my own matchbox computer
          </p>
          <h2>What is MENACE?</h2>
          <p>
            Made By ___. During the ___. For the purpose of____. 
          </p>
          <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
          <p>
            matchboxes. Each has a board on the cover and beads that decide the moves. When a sequence
            of moves leads to a win, then place back the beads plus extra. When draw put beads back, no reward.
            When loss, take beads out. Normally starts with a specific number of beads in each box, but I start
            with one of each in each box and have it learn from there. The idea is to make it  fail proof, and to
            learn faster.
          </p>
