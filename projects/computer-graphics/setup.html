          <h1>Set Up</h1>

          <h2>Creating The Game Loop</h2>
          <p>
            In SDL, one first has to call the init method to generate the underlying
            subsystems that will be used.
          </p>

          <p>
            After things were initialized the next step was to create a window and a
            surface.
          </p>

          <p>
            The general idea is that a surface is a buffer that you can draw to, and a
            window is the area of the screen that you can display the contents of a
            surface.
          </p>

          <p>
            The next important step is to create a loop that holds the program open so that
            the window doesn't close the instant it is created. To do this, I created a
            loop that checks if the user wants to quit the application. Then I created a
            loop that handels events. If the quit event occurs, then it will set the quit
            flag to true on the outer loop and allow the program to close.
          </p>

          <p>
            After exiting the loop some cleanup needs to be done to exit the program
            nicely.
          </p>

          <p>
            At this point I had a program with an openable and closeable window. Perfect!
          </p>

          <h2>Limiting The Frame Rate</h2>
          <p>
            At the moment my program opens a blank window. It also uses a lot of resources,
            because there are no mechanisms to limit how fast the computer will execute the
            program. This is inefficient. To make my computer utilize fewer resources, I
            decided to cap the frame rate by adding a delay.<br><br>

            This is done by calculating how long it takes to get through the game loop.
            Then that time is used to figure out how much delay is needed to get the
            desired frame rate. <br><br>

            SDL gives back the time in milliseconds, so to achieve a desired frame rate one
            can use the formula " 1000 / frame_rate " to get how much time should pass each
            time you enter the game loop.<br><br>

            This can be calculated by getting the time when entering the loop (start_time)
            and the time when leaving the loop (end_time). Then you subtract the starting
            time from the ending time to get the total amount of time that has elapsed
            going through the loop (delta_time). Then we can sue the formula " (1000 /
            frame_rate) - delta " to get the amount of time that we need to delay to
            achieve our desired frame rate.<br><br>
          </p>

          <h2>Recap</h2>
          <p>
            If we want a frame rate of 60 frames per second, then we know that it should
            take " 1000 / 60 " milliseconds to go through the loop.<br><br>

            frame_rate = 60fps<br>
            desired_delta = 1000 / 60<br><br>

            The time it actually took to get through the loop is given by subtracting the
            ending time from the start time<br><br>

            actual_delta = time_end - time_start<br><br>

            Finally, we wait so that the time elapsed is equal to our desired delta time,
            and how long to wait is given by the following formula:<br><br>

            delay = desired_delta - actual_delta
          </p>

          <h2>Drawing A Pixel to The Screen</h2>
          <p>
            Now that I have a window, a suface to draw to, and am limiting the frame rate
            the only thing left before I can go through the book is to draw a pixel to the
            screen.<br><br>

            A Renderer is needed to draw things in SDL. If you want to draw to a window
            use a renderer, but to draw to a surface use a softwareRenderer.<br><br>

            Drawing is a two step process:<br>
              1. set the drawing color<br>
              2. draw something to the screen<br><br>

            To set hte drawing color call the SetRenderColor fuction and pass it the
            renderer to set its color.<br><br>

            To draw a pixel use the RenderPlacePoint function to draw a point at an (x,y)
            coordinate on the surface.
          </p>

          <h1>Ok... Now What?</h1>
          <p>
            I have set up a simple project that implements everything needed for me to feel
            comfortable starting the book. While the code works, it will need to be
            refactored at some point. I am deferring refactoring until I read enough of the
            book to assess what kind of structure for the project will work well.
